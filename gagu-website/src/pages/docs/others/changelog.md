# Changelog

GAGU is currently in the Alpha stage, and a version is updated about every three weeks, depending on the progress of work and study.

Before the release of v1.0.0, the data fields may be adjusted several times, and GAGU will not automatically convert the data generated in the old version for the time being, which may cause it to fail to run normally after installing the new version.

If this happens, you can execute the `gagu --reset` command to clear the local data directory generated by GAGU, and then re-execute `gagu` to start the service.

The location of the data directory generated by different devices is different, for details, please refer to [here](/docs/getting-started/usage#Workspace).

<div class="apply-tip">
Clear data directory means that all users, download tunnels and other data will be cleared.
